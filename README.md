Hey there! Glad you came. My name is Nicholas and I'm full stack web developer
focusing on Back-End development. I'm from RibeirÃ£o Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil,
South America, Earth...

I have worked professionally since 2013, using PHP as my main programming
language. Since then, I've been working on several companies, developing
websites, web systems for content and information management. On my personal
projects, I'm focusing on making information and content management more human
friendly.

Information and content management are my passion now. And I know I can do a
great job on this!
