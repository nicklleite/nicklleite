# Introducing...
... Nicholas. Hi, this is the new version of myself (I guess). Version 2024 (point something along side with a random alphanumeric string). And like all the things, I still got room for a lot of improvement.

## Well...
I've been a programmer (focused on web development) for about 10 years now. It took a while to finally became aware of what I really wanted to do as a web developer. I'm a **information management** maniac (at least this is how I define myself nowadays). I'm always up to any challange that includes developing a new web-based system for managing data and information of any kind (it's amazing all the big things that could be achived developing such tools). More importantly, this product will be a salvation for someone, will facilitate poeple's day-by-day tasks. That's my thing! **IMPACT LIVES WITH TECHNOLOGY!**

## But...
I think some developers are a little afraid to shout out about the areas of web development thay just dislike. Take me for example: I always make an extra effort to find job positions that don't have **ANYTHING** to do with e-commerce. *But Nicholas, e-commerce is a multi-billion industry and it's always growing!* That type of "speech" just don't have that much appeal to me anymore. I know I said that I love information and data managament (and e-commerce, in a good part, is basically that), but, been honest here... the madness of spcial comercial dates and things like that? Naa... thank you! My kind of madness is for managing, secure and do whatever is needed to transform data into information!

## Currently...
Alongside with a regular job (the one I need right now, you know? Between jobs... yeah...), I'm working as a volunteer on the development of a web-based system for educational info management. You can check the progress by accessing the repo:
